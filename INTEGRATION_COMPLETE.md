## 🚀 How to Test Your Integration

### 1. Start Your Servers

```bash
# Backend (should run on port 5000)
cd your-backend-folder
npm start

# Frontend
cd quickshift-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Connection

Open your admin dashboard and you'll see a "Backend Connection Test" panel at the top. Click "Test Connection" to verify all endpoints.

### 3. Manual Testing

- **Employers**: Navigate to admin/employers and try search, filters, verify/suspend actions
- **Users**: Navigate to admin/users and test all functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Actions should show toast notifications and refresh data

## 📋 Backend Requirements

Your Node.js backend needs these endpoints:

### Required Endpoints

```
GET    /api/employers          - List all employers
GET    /api/employers/:id      - Get employer details
PATCH  /api/employers/:id/verify   - Verify employer
PATCH  /api/employers/:id/suspend  - Suspend employer

GET    /api/users             - List all users
GET    /api/users/:id         - Get user details
PATCH  /api/users/:id         - Update user (for verify/suspend)
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "total": 100,
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 10
}
```

### CORS Configuration

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: ["http://localhost:3000"],
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"],
    allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  })
);
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

**Current `.env.local`:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

**For Production:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-deployed-backend.com
```
